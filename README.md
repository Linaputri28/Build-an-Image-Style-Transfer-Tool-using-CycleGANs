# Build an Image Style Transfer Tool using CycleGANs

Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, are a type of deep-learning generative model. A vanilla GAN's architecture involves two networks: a Generator network for generating new examples and a Discriminator network for classifying examples as real (drawn from the training data) or fake (drawn from the Generator). 
GANs typically work with images.  Depending on how we set the objective function of a GAN, the Generator can be used to generate new images that satisfy certain rules. In this guided project, we will be learning about CycleGANs, a class of GANs that can be used for transferring the style of images of one domain onto images in another domain by enforcing Cycle Consistency Loss. For instance, a CycleGAN can "translate" the photo of a landscape into a Monet-esque painting of that landscape.
